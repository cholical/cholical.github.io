                <h4>Online Guidelines</h4>
                <p> 
                    Do not disclose personal information: While a name and contact information is required, other types of personal information such as address, birthdates, social security numbers, bank and credit information, passwords, and UNC personal identification numbers should never be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verify the identity of a buyer or seller: If buyer or seller of a product contacts you through email, verify that the email ends with some form of unc.edu to ensure affiliation with the university. Also, looking up a potential buyer or seller’s name on UNC’s online database can help verify the person’s identity. Cease contact with a potential buyer or seller if you do not feel comfortable communicating with him/her.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Transaction Guidelines</h4>
                <p>
                    Meet in a public place: When conducting a transaction, never meet a potential seller or buyer in a private location. Meet in public locations such as the libraries, the Pit, the Student Union, or other UNC affiliated buildings with lots of students. Bring a friend if you do not feel comfortable making the transaction by yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only disclose specific details about a transaction, such as time and place, in private conversations (email, text, private messages, etc) and not on public forums or the comments section of this site. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make and receive payments in cash: When a transaction has been negotiated, make purchases and only accept payments in cash. Checks, money orders, PayPal, and other types of payment mediums may bounce or be reverted. Using cash is the easiest way of ensuring that payment is properly handled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conduct transactions only with people affiliated with the university: CampusCache is designed specifically for trade between students and, potentially, faculty at UNC. Conduct transactions only with people affiliated with UNC to ensure safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back out of a transaction at any time: Remember that you have the power to back out of a transaction at any time. Do not feel pressured to buy or sell anything if you have doubts about the transaction. You are not obligated to buy or sell anything even if you meet with a potential buyer or seller.
                </p>
