            <p>
                 CampusCache allows UNC students to find what they need and sell what they don't need. With a intuitive search and sorting system, users will be able to quickly contact potential buyers/sellers, negotiate prices, and conduct trades with other students on the UNC campus. Through this direct system of exchange, without a profitting middle party, students can earn back more money on textbook sales, save on new textbooks, and decrease the monetary burdens of higher education. In addition to textbooks, CampusCache provides students with a means to list and find other items and enlist the help of fellow Tar Heels in times of need.

                    <h3>How it All Began</h3>
                    <h4>A Message from the Founder</h4>
                        <p>Up until now, the textbook trade at UNC has been dominated by student bookstores, online textbook services, and the occasional self-purported “savior” start-up that merely reduces the markup of used textbooks by lowering their profits. However, they are still making profits all the same, and at every turn of the game, students are losing money.

                        <p>My vehement “distaste” for how textbook exchange is handled first developed during my freshman year at UNC. Young, optimistic, and naïve, I bought an Economics textbook from the student bookstore for my ECON 101 class. The textbook was substantial in size, glossy to the touch, and brand spanking new because that was the first year that this particular textbook would be used for the curriculum. It was also a whopping three hundred and fifty dollars.

                        <p>Throughout the semester, I perused it occasionally and kept it in top notch condition expecting to to sell it back after my course was over. When I finally filled out that last bubble on the Econ final, I carried the monster back to the student bookstore in anticipation of a sizable payout. What I was met with was a firm fifteen dollars. Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars for an almost new, originally three hundred and fifty dollar textbook that I slaved over to keep in perfect condition! To add insult to injury, I was offered one dollar for a Calculus textbook that I had bought for one hundred and thirty dollars. Furious is not strong enough a term to describe how I felt.

                        <p>In the following semester, I refused to set foot into that bookstore and refused to purchase any textbooks from any such businesses. Through my search for alternatives, I found the Textbook Exchange Facebook group for UNC. On the Facebook page, students listed the textbooks that they were selling and the textbooks that they wanted to buy. Upon first discovering the group, I was initially overjoyed at finding a platform to buy and sell textbooks without the markup of bookstores. However, I soon realized its inefficiency as well. Though great in concept, the Textbook Exchange page sorted its listings by date and recent activity. There was also no search feature or a way to compare prices between similar listings. Therefore, the only way to find the textbook that I needed was to scroll through the page for hours reading every single post.

                        <p>That was when the idea for CampusCache was born. A new interface was need that organized textbook listings properly, allowed searches based on key terms such as title and edition, and provided students with the means of finding the best deal. All without a profiting third party.
