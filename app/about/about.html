            <h3>TClassified: For the Students, Without a Catch (name will be changed in the near future)</h3>

            <p>
                 TClassified allows students to easily list their textbooks for sale and find listings for other textbooks that they need. Through this direct system of exchange, without a profitting middle party, students can earn back more money on textbook sales, save on new textbooks, and decrease the monetary burdens of higher education. In addition to textbooks, Tclassified provides students with a means to list other items for sale and enlist the help of other students in times of need.

                <h4>How it All Began</h4>
                    <h5>A Message from the Founder</h5>
                        <p>Up until now, the textbook trade has been dominated by student bookstores, online textbook services, and the occasional self-purported “savior” start-up that merely reduces the markup of used textbooks by cutting into their profits. However, they are making profits all the same, and at every turn of the game, the students are still being screwed. 

                        <p>My vehement “distaste” for how the textbook exchange is handled first developed during my freshman year at UNC. Young, optimistic, and naïve, I bought an Economics textbook from the student bookstore for my ECON 101 class. The textbook was substantial in size, glossy to the touch, and brand spanking new because that was the first year that this particular textbook would be used for the curriculum. It was also a whopping three hundred and fifty dollars. 

                        <p>Throughout the semester, I perused it occasionally and kept it in top notch condition expecting to be able to sell it back after my course was over. When I finally filled out that last bubble on the Econ final, I carried the monster back to the student bookstore in anticipation of a sizable payout. What I was met with was a firm fifteen dollars. Fifteen fucking dollars! Fifteen fucking dollars for an almost new, originally three hundred and fifty dollar textbook that I slaved over to keep in great condition! To add insult to injury, I was offered one dollar for a Calculus textbook that I had bought used from the exact same bookstore for one hundred and thirty dollars. Fucking furious was not strong enough a term to describe how I felt. 

                        <p>In the following semester, I refused to set foot into that bookstore and refused to purchase any textbooks from such businesses. Through my search for alternatives, I found the Textbook Exchange Facebook group for UNC. On the Facebook page, students listed the textbooks that they were selling and the textbooks that they wanted to buy. Upon first discovering the group, I was overjoyed at finding a platform to buy and sell textbooks without the markup of bookstores. However, I soon realized its inefficiency as well. Though noble in its ideal, as a standard Facebook group, the Textbook Exchange page sorted its listings by date and recent activity. There was also no search feature or a way to compare prices between similar listings. 

                        <p>That was when the idea for TClassified was born. A new interface was need that organized textbook listings properly, allowed searches based on title, class, and edition, and provided students with the means of finding the best deal. All without a profiting third party. 

                    <h4>Our Solution</strong></h4>

                        <p>TClassified serves that very purpose: it allows students to find what they need and get rid of what they don’t need. It is a lightweight online application compatible with mobile that allows students to post the textbooks they want to sell and search for textbooks they need. When a promising deal is found, a student can merely contact the other party and directly negotiate an exchange. Fast, simple, and without making money off students, TClassified is created with the goal of maximizing efficiency and reducing loss. There are no transaction fees, no subscription obligations, no spam, and currently no ads. TClassified is for the students, without a catch.
