			TClassified provides students at UNC with a simple and effective means of buying and selling textbooks. Our application, built with the consumer in mind, is completely free to use, maximizes efficiency of transactions, and keeps the money of students strictly in the pockets of students. Join us as we enter a new era where the backs of students are not bowed by the crippling debt of education, where businesses do not exist purely to make profit off of those who have no other choice, where the buffalo roam, where the deer and antelope play, where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and where the skies are not cloudy all day.
